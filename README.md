# Chess AI: An AlphaZero-Inspired Agent

This project implements an artificial intelligence that plays chess without human evaluation, inspired by concepts from the AlphaZero algorithm. The agent uses neural networks to evaluate positions and trains by playing self-games.

## Description

This project utilizes the `python-chess` library to handle the rules of the game and `PyTorch` to create and train the AI model. The agent trains itself by playing multiple games against itself, evaluating its performance, and learning from its mistakes.

## Features

- **Play Chess**: The agent can play against itself using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns to play by training on self-played games.
- **Position Evaluation**: Uses a neural network to evaluate game positions.

## Installation

To run this project in Google Colab, execute the following cell to install the necessary dependencies:

```python
!pip install python-chess chess
